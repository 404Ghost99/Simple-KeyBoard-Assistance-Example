Hi, this is program is called "keyboard assistance" inspired by [this](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky)
This program is very dummy and simple :D the program just only to open facebook in your browser 

i'm using arduino promicro for running this program, this code is OpenSource, anyone can modify this code ;) 

Enjoy!
