Hi, this is program is called "keyboard assistance" i'm just inspired by https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky.git
This program is very dummy and simple :D the program just only to open facebook in your browser and just for fun :) 

i'm using arduino promicro for running this program, this code is OpenSource, anyone can modify this code ;) 

Enjoy!
